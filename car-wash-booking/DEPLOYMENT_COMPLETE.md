## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed

**Check logs:**
```
https://app.netlify.com/sites/kiiltoloisto-fi/deploys
```

**Common fixes:**
```bash
# Update dependencies
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update dependencies"
git push

# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
git add prisma/
git commit -m "Regenerate Prisma"
git push
```

### 403 Forbidden

**Fix access control:**
1. Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings
2. Access control → Visitor access
3. Set to "Public" (not "Password protected")
4. Save changes

### Functions Not Working

**Check logs:**
```bash
netlify functions:list
netlify functions:log bookings-create
```

**Verify environment variables:**
```bash
netlify env:list
# Make sure DATABASE_URL is set
```

### Database Connection Issues

**Verify DATABASE_URL:**
```bash
netlify env:get DATABASE_URL
# Should show your Supabase connection string
```

**Test connection locally:**
```bash
npm run prisma:studio
# If this works, DATABASE_URL is correct
```
