GitHub Token Updated Successfully
================================

Date: 2025-10-01
User: behark
Token: ghp_nmOOmu... (first 10 chars)

Status: ✅ VERIFIED AND WORKING

Locations Updated:
- ~/.zshrc (permanent shell configuration)
- .env (project environment file)
- Current session environment

Verification:
✅ Token is valid
✅ GitHub API access confirmed
✅ Authenticated as: behark
✅ Public repos: 26

Next Steps:
1. Restart Claude Code/MCP servers to pick up new token
2. Token will automatically load in all new shell sessions
3. Token is secured in .env (which is in .gitignore)

Security Notes:
- Token has been set with proper environment variable names
- Both GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN are set
- .env is properly gitignored to prevent accidental commits
- Token backups stored in .zshrc.bak and .env.bak if needed

To verify in future sessions:
  echo $GITHUB_TOKEN
  gh api user
