# üì¶ How to Import Environment Variables to Netlify

## Method 1: Import from .env file (EASIEST! ‚≠ê)

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Download the file**: `.env.netlify.production` (in your project root)

2. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Login: https://app.netlify.com/
   - Select your site
   - Click **Site Settings** (top menu)
   - Click **Environment variables** (left sidebar)

3. **Click the Import button**:
   - Look for **"Import from .env"** button (top right area)
   - Click it

4. **Upload the file**:
   - Select `.env.netlify.production` from your computer
   - Click **Import**

5. **Done!** ‚úÖ
   - All 5 variables imported instantly
   - Go to **Deploys** ‚Üí **Trigger deploy**

## Method 2: Using Netlify CLI (For Advanced Users)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Link to your site
netlify link

# Import environment variables
netlify env:import .env.netlify.production

# Verify
netlify env:list
```

## Method 3: Manual Copy-Paste (Slower)

If import doesn't work, copy from the file and add manually:

1. Open `.env.netlify.production`
2. For each line (that's not commented):
   - Click **Add a variable** in Netlify
   - Copy the KEY (left side of `=`)
   - Copy the VALUE (right side, remove quotes)
   - Scope: **All scopes**
   - Click **Create variable**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### File Location:
- File must be in your project root
- Named: `.env.netlify.production`
- Format: `KEY="value"` (with quotes)

### Scopes:
- When importing, Netlify auto-assigns to "All scopes"
- This is what you want ‚úÖ

### Security:
- ‚ùå DO NOT commit this file to git (already in .gitignore)
- ‚úÖ Keep it locally for reference
- ‚úÖ Store admin password in password manager

### Comments:
- Lines starting with `#` are ignored (commented)
- To enable optional variables:
  - Remove the `#` at start of line
  - Add actual value
  - Re-import file
