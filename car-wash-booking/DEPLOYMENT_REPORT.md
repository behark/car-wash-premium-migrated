# Deployment Report - Kiiltoloisto.fi Car Wash Booking System

## Executive Summary
**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Site URL**: https://kiiltoloisto.fi
**Current Status**: ⚠️ **Partially Operational** - Main site has redirect loop, API functions are accessible

## Issues Diagnosed and Addressed

### 1. 403 Forbidden Error - Root Cause Analysis
**Initial Issue**: Site was returning 403 Forbidden error
**Root Causes Identified**:
- Missing Netlify Next.js plugin (`@netlify/plugin-nextjs`)
- Environment variable mismatch (www vs non-www URLs)
- Overly complex redirect rules causing loops
- CSP policy potentially blocking resources

**Actions Taken**:
✅ Installed `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` dependency
✅ Fixed environment variables (NEXTAUTH_URL now matches NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL)
✅ Simplified netlify.toml configuration
✅ Removed problematic trailing slash redirect
✅ Simplified CSP policy

### 2. Current Deployment Status

**Latest Deployments**:
- ❌ 2025-10-03T21:10:05 - Build failed (exit code 2)
- ❌ 2025-10-03T21:06:45 - Build failed
- ✅ 2025-10-03T20:34:55 - Last successful deployment

**Build Issues**:
- ESLint warning during builds (non-critical)
- TypeScript configuration auto-installing dependencies
- Build completes locally but fails on Netlify

### 3. System Health Check Results

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Main Site (/) | ❌ 301 Redirect Loop | Site redirects to itself infinitely |
| DNS Configuration | ✅ Working | A Record: 63.176.8.218 |
| Netlify Functions | ✅ Partially Working | Direct function calls work |
| API Routes (/api/*) | ❌ Not Working | Redirecting with 301 |
| Environment Variables | ✅ Configured | All critical variables set |
| Database Connection | ✅ Working | PostgreSQL on Supabase |
| SSL Certificate | ✅ Active | HTTPS working |

### 4. Working Components

**Functional Elements**:
- ✅ `/.netlify/functions/services-index` - Returns 200 OK
- ✅ Database connection to Supabase PostgreSQL
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ DNS properly configured
- ✅ Build process completes successfully locally

### 5. Non-Working Components

**Issues Requiring Attention**:
- ❌ Main site has redirect loop (301 → 301 → 301...)
- ❌ API routes not properly mapped to Netlify functions
- ❌ Recent deployments failing during build stage
- ⚠️ SendGrid API key is placeholder value

## Environment Configuration

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[CONFIGURED]
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[SET]
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://kiiltoloisto.fi
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://kiiltoloisto.fi
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.test-key-placeholder  # ⚠️ Needs real key
```

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1 - Fix Redirect Loop
1. Review and potentially revert recent netlify.toml changes
2. Consider rolling back to deployment `68e0336f0c413e0008af8210` (last working)
3. Check for any middleware causing redirects

### Priority 2 - Fix Build Failures
1. Install ESLint as dev dependency to resolve warning
2. Review build logs on Netlify dashboard for specific errors
3. Ensure all TypeScript types are properly installed

### Priority 3 - Complete Configuration
1. Obtain and set proper SendGrid API key for email functionality
2. Test booking flow end-to-end once site is accessible
3. Configure payment processing (Stripe keys if applicable)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Within 1 Hour)
1. **Rollback to Last Working Version**
   ```bash
   netlify api restoreSiteDeploy --data='{"site_id":"9753561d-0777-4b0c-a669-324e3d49b8ee","deploy_id":"68e0336f0c413e0008af8210"}'
   ```

2. **Clear CDN Cache**
   - Clear Netlify's CDN cache
   - Clear any browser caches

3. **Test Core Functionality**
   - Verify site loads without redirect loop
   - Test booking flow
   - Verify API endpoints

### Short-term (Within 24 Hours)
1. Fix ESLint installation issue
2. Implement proper error tracking (Sentry)
3. Set up uptime monitoring
4. Configure real SendGrid API key
5. Test complete booking flow with payments

### Long-term (Within 1 Week)
1. Implement CI/CD pipeline with staging environment
2. Add comprehensive test suite
3. Set up automated backups
4. Implement performance monitoring
5. Configure auto-scaling policies

## Files Modified

1. **netlify.toml** - Simplified configuration, removed problematic redirects
2. **package.json** - Added @netlify/plugin-nextjs dependency
3. **scripts/fix-netlify-deployment.sh** - Created deployment fix script
4. **scripts/monitor-deployment.sh** - Created monitoring script

## Deployment Scripts Created

### 1. fix-netlify-deployment.sh
Comprehensive script to fix deployment issues:
- Checks Netlify CLI installation
- Sets environment variables
- Builds and deploys project
- Configures domains

### 2. monitor-deployment.sh
Health monitoring script that checks:
- HTTP status
- API endpoints
- Environment variables
- Build history
- DNS configuration

## Technical Debt Identified

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - ESLint not installed as dev dependency
   - Some TypeScript types auto-installing during build

2. **Configuration Issues**
   - Complex redirect rules need simplification
   - PWA configuration disabled due to conflicts

3. **Security Considerations**
   - SendGrid API key using placeholder
   - CSP policy may be too restrictive

## Monitoring Setup

Created comprehensive monitoring script that checks:
- Site accessibility (HTTP status codes)
- API endpoint health
- Environment variable configuration
- Recent deployment history
- DNS configuration

Run monitoring: `./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh`

## Success Metrics

Once fully operational, the system should meet these criteria:
- [ ] Site loads without errors or redirects (HTTP 200)
- [ ] All API endpoints return proper responses
- [ ] Booking flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Email notifications are sent
- [ ] Payment processing functions
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] PWA features enabled
- [ ] Performance score > 90 on Lighthouse

## Conclusion

The deployment has been partially successful with the following achievements:
- ✅ Root cause of 403 error identified and addressed
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ Netlify functions are accessible
- ✅ Monitoring and deployment scripts created

However, a redirect loop issue has emerged that needs immediate attention. The recommended action is to rollback to the last working deployment while investigating the redirect configuration further.
