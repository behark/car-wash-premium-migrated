# Database Architecture - Car Wash Booking System

## Overview
This document describes the optimized database architecture implemented to resolve critical memory leaks and connection exhaustion issues in the car wash booking system's serverless environment.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Memory Leaks
**Problem**: New PrismaClient instances were created per request without proper cleanup, causing memory leaks.

**Solution**: Implemented a centralized Prisma client singleton with proper connection management that:
- Reuses connections across function invocations
- Properly disconnects after operations
- Implements connection pooling optimized for serverless

### 2. Connection Exhaustion
**Problem**: Each function invocation created new database connections without limits, exhausting the connection pool.

**Solution**: Configured optimized connection pooling with:
- Maximum 5 connections per function instance
- 10-second connection timeout
- Automatic connection retry with exponential backoff
- PgBouncer mode support for connection pooling

### 3. Duplicate Prisma Schemas
**Problem**: 40+ duplicate Prisma schemas scattered across Netlify functions directories.

**Solution**:
- Centralized schema management
- Cleaned up duplicate schemas
- All functions now use shared Prisma client

## New Architecture Components

### 1. Centralized Prisma Client (`/netlify/functions/lib/prisma.ts`)
- **Singleton Pattern**: Prevents multiple client instantiations
- **Connection Management**: Handles connect/disconnect lifecycle
- **withPrisma Wrapper**: Ensures proper cleanup on all code paths
- **withRetry Wrapper**: Implements exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Health Check**: Built-in database health monitoring

Key features:
```typescript
// Automatic connection management
const result = await withPrisma(async (prisma) => {
  return await prisma.service.findMany();
});

// Automatic retry on transient failures
const result = await withRetry(async () =>
  withPrisma(async (prisma) => {
    return await prisma.booking.create({...});
  })
);
```

### 2. Database Monitoring (`/netlify/functions/lib/db-monitor.ts`)
- **Query Performance Tracking**: Monitors slow queries (>500ms)
- **Error Tracking**: Logs and analyzes database errors
- **Connection Pool Metrics**: Tracks active/idle/waiting connections
- **Health Reporting**: Provides comprehensive health status

Metrics tracked:
- Total/active/idle connections
- Query count and average time
- Slow query identification
- Error rates and patterns
- Memory usage

### 3. Health Check Endpoint (`/netlify/functions/debug-health.ts`)
Provides comprehensive system diagnostics:
- Database connectivity and latency
- Connection pool status
- Memory usage statistics
- Recent errors and slow queries
- Environment configuration status

Access at: `/.netlify/functions/debug-health`

## Optimized Connection Settings

### PostgreSQL URL Parameters
```
postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?
  connection_limit=5&       # Max connections per function
  pool_timeout=10&          # Wait max 10s for connection
  connect_timeout=10&       # Connection timeout
  statement_cache_size=0&   # Disable cache in serverless
  pgbouncer=true           # Enable PgBouncer if available
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Optional optimization overrides
DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10
DB_POOL_TIMEOUT=10
DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=10

# Monitoring
ENABLE_DB_MONITORING=true
SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD=1000
MAX_QUERY_HISTORY=100
```

## Updated Functions

All Netlify functions have been updated to use the new architecture:

1. **services-index.ts** - Service listing
2. **services-id.ts** - Single service retrieval
3. **bookings-create.ts** - Booking creation with transactions
4. **bookings-availability.ts** - Availability checking
5. **payment-create-session.ts** - Stripe session creation
6. **payment-webhook.ts** - Payment webhook processing
7. **debug-health.ts** - System health monitoring

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Connection Management
- Always use `withPrisma` wrapper for database operations
- Never create PrismaClient directly in functions
- Implement proper error handling and cleanup

### 2. Transaction Handling
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Keep transactions as short as possible
- Handle transaction rollbacks gracefully

### 3. Error Handling
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Log errors with context for debugging
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Use connection pooling with appropriate limits
- Monitor and optimize slow queries
- Implement caching where appropriate

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Check Monitoring
Regular health checks should monitor:
- Database connectivity
- Connection pool usage (<70% ideal)
- Query performance (avg <500ms)
- Error rates (<1% ideal)
- Memory usage

### Alerts to Configure
1. Connection pool usage >90%
2. Average query time >1000ms
3. Error rate >5%
4. Database unreachable
5. Memory usage >90%

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. Review slow query logs weekly
2. Analyze error patterns monthly
3. Update connection pool settings based on usage
4. Clean up old logs and temporary data
5. Update Prisma schema and regenerate client as needed

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. Never instantiate PrismaClient directly
2. Always use provided wrappers:
   - `withPrisma` for single operations
   - `withRetry` for critical operations
3. Check health endpoint when debugging
4. Review monitoring metrics regularly

### For DevOps
1. Set DATABASE_URL with optimization parameters
2. Configure monitoring alerts
3. Set up health check monitoring
4. Review connection pool settings monthly
5. Monitor memory usage trends

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### High Connection Pool Usage
- Reduce `connection_limit` parameter
- Increase `pool_timeout` for better queuing
- Review code for connection leaks

#### Slow Queries
- Check indexes on frequently queried fields
- Review query complexity
- Consider implementing caching

#### Memory Issues
- Verify proper disconnection in all code paths
- Check for large result sets
- Review function memory allocation

#### Connection Timeouts
- Increase `connect_timeout` parameter
- Check network latency to database
- Verify database server resources

## Future Improvements

### Short Term (1-3 months)
1. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. Add query result caching with smart invalidation
3. Implement database read replicas for scaling
4. Add APM (Application Performance Monitoring) integration

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. Migrate to managed connection pooling service
2. Implement database sharding for scale
3. Add real-time monitoring dashboard
4. Implement automated performance tuning

## Conclusion

The implemented database architecture resolves all critical issues identified:
- **Memory leaks eliminated** through proper connection management
- **Connection exhaustion prevented** with pooling limits
- **Performance optimized** with monitoring and retry logic
- **Maintainability improved** with centralized client management

The system is now production-ready with proper error handling, monitoring, and scalability patterns suitable for serverless environments.
