# 🚨 URGENT FIX: Base Directory Issue

## Problem Found:
```
npm error path /opt/build/repo/package.json
npm error errno -2
npm error enoent Could not read package.json
```

**Cause**: Your code is in `car-wash-booking/` subdirectory, but Netlify is looking in the root!

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX (Do This Now):

### Go Back to Netlify Build Settings:

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/
2. **Your site** → **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
3. **Click**: "Edit settings" or "Configure" under Build settings
4. **Find**: "Base directory" field

### Set Base Directory:

```
Base directory: car-wash-booking
```

### Keep Other Settings As:

```
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: .
Functions directory: netlify/functions
```

---

## 📸 Visual Guide:

Looking at the error, Netlify is in: `/opt/build/repo/`
But your code is in: `/opt/build/repo/car-wash-booking/`

**Fix**: Tell Netlify to cd into `car-wash-booking` first!

---

## 🔧 Complete Build Settings:

```
Base directory: car-wash-booking
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: .
Functions directory: netlify/functions
```

---

## 🚀 After Fixing:

1. **Save** the settings
2. **Trigger** a new deploy:
   - Deploys tab → "Trigger deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"

---

## ✅ This Will Work Because:

Your repository structure:
```
/
├── .git/
└── car-wash-booking/          ← Code is HERE
    ├── package.json           ← Netlify needs to find THIS
    ├── netlify.toml
    ├── next.config.js
    └── ...
```

With base directory set, Netlify will:
```
cd car-wash-booking/    ← Base directory
npm run build           ← Build command (now finds package.json!)
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Edit build settings
- [ ] Set base directory: `car-wash-booking`
- [ ] Save settings
- [ ] Trigger new deploy
- [ ] Watch build succeed!

**Do this now and your build will work!** 🚀
