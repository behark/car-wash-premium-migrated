# üö® CRITICAL 403 ERROR - SOLUTION & DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## Root Cause Analysis

The 403 Forbidden error on kiiltoloisto.fi was caused by an incorrect Netlify deployment configuration where:

1. **Incorrect publish directory**: The `netlify.toml` was pointing to `.next` but Next.js with SSR needs proper plugin configuration
2. **Missing Next.js plugin configuration**: The @netlify/plugin-nextjs wasn't properly configured
3. **Build output mismatch**: Next.js was building for SSR but Netlify was trying to serve it as static files

## ‚úÖ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Fixed Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- Corrected the build command and publish directory
- Properly configured the @netlify/plugin-nextjs for SSR/ISR support
- Added performance headers and caching strategies
- Configured API redirects with `force = true` to ensure proper routing

### 2. Updated Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)
- Removed static export configuration
- Enabled image optimization with proper domains
- Added SWC minification for better performance
- Configured compiler optimizations

### 3. Performance Optimizations Added
- Created optimized image component with lazy loading
- Added web vitals monitoring
- Implemented critical CSS inlining
- Optimized font loading strategy
- Added resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)

## üìã DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Commit and push changes:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve 403 error and optimize performance"
git push origin master
```

2. **Netlify will automatically deploy** from your Git repository

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Netlify CLI

1. **Install Netlify CLI (if not installed):**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

2. **Login to Netlify:**
```bash
netlify login
```

3. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```

4. **Deploy to production:**
```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next --site=9753561d-0777-4b0c-a669-324e3d49b8ee
```

### Option 3: Use the Deployment Script

```bash
chmod +x scripts/fix-403-deploy.sh
./scripts/fix-403-deploy.sh
```

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After deployment, verify these items:

### Frontend Pages
- [ ] Homepage loads at https://kiiltoloisto.fi ‚úÖ
- [ ] Booking page works at https://kiiltoloisto.fi/booking
- [ ] Contact page loads at https://kiiltoloisto.fi/contact
- [ ] Services page displays correctly

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Services API: https://kiiltoloisto.fi/.netlify/functions/services-index
- [ ] Availability API: https://kiiltoloisto.fi/.netlify/functions/bookings-availability
- [ ] Booking creation works end-to-end

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.8s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3.8s
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1

## üöÄ PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

### Implemented Optimizations:
1. **Image Optimization**
   - Next.js Image component with WebP/AVIF formats
   - Lazy loading with blur placeholders
   - Responsive image sizes

2. **Font Optimization**
   - Reduced font families from 4 to 1 (Inter)
   - Added font-display: swap
   - Preloaded critical font files

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Static assets: 1 year cache
   - API responses: No cache for dynamic content
   - HTML pages: Stale-while-revalidate

4. **Code Splitting**
   - Dynamic imports for non-critical components
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Removed unused CSS/JS

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

After deployment, you should see:
- **Lighthouse Performance Score**: 90+
- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3.8 seconds
- **Core Web Vitals**: All green

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

If the 403 error persists:

1. **Clear Netlify cache:**
```bash
netlify deploy --prod --clear-cache
```

2. **Check build logs:**
```bash
netlify logs
```

3. **Verify environment variables:**
- Ensure all required env vars are set in Netlify dashboard
- Check NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain

4. **Force redeploy:**
- Go to Netlify dashboard
- Trigger a clear cache and deploy

## üìà MONITORING

Set up monitoring to track performance:

1. **Google PageSpeed Insights**: Test regularly at https://pagespeed.web.dev
2. **Web Vitals**: Monitor in browser console (already configured)
3. **Netlify Analytics**: Check in Netlify dashboard

## üîÑ MAINTENANCE

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. **Weekly**: Check Lighthouse scores
2. **Monthly**: Review and optimize images
3. **Quarterly**: Update dependencies and review performance

## üí° ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Enable Netlify Edge Functions** (when stable) for better performance
2. **Implement ISR** for dynamic pages that don't change often
3. **Add CDN** for static assets if traffic increases
4. **Consider Cloudflare** for additional DDoS protection

## üìû SUPPORT

If issues persist after following this guide:
1. Check Netlify status page: https://www.netlifystatus.com
2. Review build logs in Netlify dashboard
3. Contact Netlify support with site ID: 9753561d-0777-4b0c-a669-324e3d49b8ee
